            My name is Mikenson St Louis, I am from Haiti. 
            I am married, father of four children. 
            I was a teacher in Haiti. 
            I taught children from 8 to 12 years old. 
            I work at Boston College. 
            I started studying last year at Boston College. 
            I am starting the second year. 
            My field of study is computer science. 
            I will be happy to acquire more knowledge 
            in order to better know the society in which I live 
            and to be able to reuse what I will have to learn after my studies.
